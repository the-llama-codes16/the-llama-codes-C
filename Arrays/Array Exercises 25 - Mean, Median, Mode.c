/* A program that computes the arithmetic mean (average),
median, and mode for up to 50 test scores. The data are
contained in a text file. The program will also print a
histogram of the scores.

The program starts with a function to read the data file
and fill the array. There may be fewer than 50 scores. This
will require that the read function return the index for the
last element in the array.

To determine average, write a function similar to a written
program in the book.
To determine median, the array must be sorted first. The median
is the score in the middle of the range. This can be determined
by selecting the score at last / 2 if last is odd.
The mode is the score that occurs the most often. It can be
determined as a byproduct of building a histogram.
